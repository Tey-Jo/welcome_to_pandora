        <strong>Pandora</strong>
        is the fifth moon of the gas giant Polyphemus (both names reference figures in Greek mythology), which orbits
        Alpha Centauri A in the Alpha Centauri System, the closest star system to our own sun.
        <br>

        Pandora is mysterious, primal and terrifying. Even from orbit, the scope of florae present on the surface
        indicates a moon brimming with life. In the canopy below, other exotic animals roam. Other than the richness of
        varying colors, the trees resemble those of Earth. They have the familiar trunks, branches and leaves, though
        due
        to the difference in gravity, many of the shapes appear strange to humans and the proportions are greater
        because
        of the lower gravity.<br>

        Pandora, despite being almost as large as Earth, is only a moon of the gas giant Polyphemus, which has thirteen
        other moons. However, due to the smaller size, its gravity is 20% less than Earth's. Creatures roam the air and
        forest canopy below, similar to Earth's animals, but on a scale several times larger. Pandora's wildlife also
        have
        bioluminescent qualities. Depending on the position of the various moons, Pandora can have two or even three
        moons
        in its sky at once. Pandora and the other moons cast large black shadows on Polyphemus.
        <br>

        Pandora looks like a lush paradise by Earth standards during the day, but at night, virtually all life on the
        moon
        exhibits bioluminescent qualities in various shades of blue, purple and green.
